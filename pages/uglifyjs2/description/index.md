title: Description

A JS minifier with more aggressive set of default options. Options are configurable
in your project's `package.json`.

> **Interesting side effect**<br/>
  This package increases security by removing part of
  your server side code which is normally included by the Meteor's
  [standard minifier](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/standard-minifier-js).
