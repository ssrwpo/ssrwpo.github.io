**SSRWPO** - **S**erver **S**ide **R**endering with **W**eb **P**erformance **O**ptimization.

Our organization provides packages that integrates best practices in the field of SSR
and WPO for [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Meteor](meteor.com), a Node based framework.

To avoid abandonware syndromes or one man army effort, we have teamed up developers
all around the world from different companies. All our developments are done under
the MIT licenses.

Feel free to contribute to one of our repos: https://github.com/ssrwpo
