### Localization and react-intl
We use react-intl for server side rendered localization. It gets the user browser language and serves the right language.

Do not need it. See [FAQ](https://github.com/ssr-server/ssr/blob/master/FAQ.md) how to remove from [demo](https://github.com/ssr-server/ssr/tree/master/demo) app.
